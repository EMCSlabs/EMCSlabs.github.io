Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

\begin{aligned}(f*g)(t)&\,{\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\ \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(\tau )\,g(t-\tau )\,d\tau \&=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(t-\tau )\,g(\tau )\,d\tau \end{aligned}
