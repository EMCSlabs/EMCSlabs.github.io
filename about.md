We are a team of researchers dedicated to interdisciplinary research in the language and speech sciences. As a team, we propose a research paradigm that employs state-of-the-art methodologies from cognitive science, neuroscience, computer science, statistics, electrical engineering, and physics. The areas of our current projects range widely from speech production and perception, reading, speech/language processing, to speech engineering technology. We fully utilize fMRI, EEG, eye-tracking, EMA (elctromagnetic articulography) and a range of computer programming tools (MATLAB, Python, R, etc.), as well as relevant machine learning algorithms (Hidden Markov Model, Artificial Neural Network, Deep Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, etc.).

We hold daily and weekly journal club meetings, tech meetings and mini-lectures by each of the members and invited speakers from all over the universe. Whoever is willing to dedicate your life to meet our "Do 5M's" (use MAC, be MAD, love MATH, love MATLAB, become MONSTERS) and "Don't 5M's" (use MS, be MILD, love MYTH, love MANUAL, become MORONS) is welcome to join us.
